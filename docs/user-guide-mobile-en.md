## Viewing Rhythms

The mobile version displays rhythms in a read-only grid view.

### Understanding the Grid

- Each **row** represents an instrument track
- Each **column** represents a time step
- **Filled cells** show active strokes with icons/letters
- **Empty cells** indicate rests (silence)
- **Separators** divide steps into groups based on subdivision

### Step Numbers

- Numbers above the grid indicate step positions (1, 2, 3...)
- Groups help you see the beat structure (e.g., groups of 4 for 4/4 time)

### Current Position

- During playback, the **current step** is highlighted
- The grid automatically scrolls to keep the playhead visible

---

## Track Controls

Each track has controls in the left column.

### Volume Slider

- Drag left/right to adjust volume (0-100%)
- Volume at 0 effectively mutes the track
- Changes apply globally to all occurrences of that instrument

### Mute Button

- Tap the **speaker icon** (🔊) to mute
- Tap again (🔇) to unmute
- Muted tracks appear dimmed with strikethrough names

> **Note**: Volume and mute settings are not saved — they reset when loading a new rhythm.
